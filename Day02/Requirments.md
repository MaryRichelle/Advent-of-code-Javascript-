# Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

## Direction Consistency

- The report must either have all increasing numbers or all decreasing numbers.
- If a change in direction (increase to decrease or vice versa) happens, the report is unsafe.
Valid Differences:

- The difference between any two consecutive numbers should be at least 1 and at most 3.
